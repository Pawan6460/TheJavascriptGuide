// First-Class Functions: In JavaScript, functions are treated as values, meaning they can be:
//✅ Assigned to variables
//✅ Passed as arguments
//✅ Returned from other functions

function operate(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
}
  
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
  
console.log(operate(5, 3, add));
// ✔ add is passed as an argument and executed inside operate.


//  Definition: A function that executes immediately after declaration. IIFE
(function () {
    console.log("I am an IIFE!");
  })(); // "I am an IIFE!"

//  ✔ Used for encapsulation to avoid polluting the global scope.

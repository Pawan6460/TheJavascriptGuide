   // Arrow functions provide a concise syntax to write functions in JavaScript. 
   //They were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and are widely used in modern JavaScript development.

   const add = (a, b) => a + b;

   // how 'this' is used
   // regular function : Dynamic (depends on how it's called)
   // ARROW Function : Lexical (inherits from parent scope)


   //Arrow Functions Do Not Have Their Own this, inherit this from their surrounding lexical scope.

   const user = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: function () {
      console.log(this.name);
    },
  };
  
  user.greet(); // "Alice" (this refers to 'user' object)

  const userOth = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: () => {
      console.log(this.name);
    },
  };
  
  userOth.greet(); // Undefined (this refers to global/window object)
  // Arrow functions do not have their own this, so this.name is undefined!

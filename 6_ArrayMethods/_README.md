Deep Dive: Array Methods in JavaScript


JavaScript arrays come with powerful built-in methods that help in transforming, filtering, iterating, and reducing data effectively.

Method	Purpose
.map()	Transforms each element and returns a new array
.filter()	Filters elements based on a condition
.reduce()	Reduces an array to a single value
.forEach()	Iterates through each element (without returning a new array)
.find()	Finds the first matching element
.some() / .every()	Checks conditions on elements
.includes()	Checks if a value exists in an array
.sort()	Sorts an array (mutates the original array)
.reverse()	Reverses the order of elements
.splice()	Adds or removes elements at specific indexes
.slice()	Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array

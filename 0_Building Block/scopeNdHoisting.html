    //Scope determines where variables and functions can be accessed in your code.

   // Types of Scope in JavaScript:
//1️⃣ Global Scope – Variables declared outside any function are globally accessible.
//2️⃣ Function (Local) Scope – Variables declared inside a function exist only within that function.
//3️⃣ Block Scope (ES6) – let and const variables are restricted to the block {} in which they are declared.
//4️⃣ Lexical Scope (Closures) – A function can access variables defined in its outer scope.

//IMP
//Note: var does NOT have block scope. It ignores {} and leaks outside.
{
    var leakedVar = "I'm NOT block-scoped!";
  }
  
console.log(leakedVar);

// with var are hoisted, but only their declaration, not initialization.
// does not assign 10 until execution.
console.log(a); // ❌ Undefined (Not ReferenceError)
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // ✅ 10

// Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but not initialized. 
//Accessing them before declaration throws a ReferenceError.

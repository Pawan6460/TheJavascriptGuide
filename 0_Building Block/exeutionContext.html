// About execution context:
// An Execution Context (EC) is an environment in which JavaScript code is executed. Every time a function runs
// or the script starts, JavaScript creates an execution context that determines 
// how the code is interpreted and executed.


// There are three main types of execution contexts in JavaScript:
// Global Execution Context (GEC) – The default execution context that is created when a JavaScript file runs. 
// It contains global variables and functions.

// Function Execution Context (FEC) – Created when a function is invoked, containing its own variables and scope.

// Eval Execution Context – Created when the eval() function is used (rarely recommended).
function first() {
    console.log("First function");
    second();
  }
  
  function second() {
      //second() is called → new Execution Context is pushed.
    console.log("Second function");
    third();
  }
  
  function third() {
  //third() is called → new Execution Context is pushed.
  console.log("Third function");
  }
  
  first(); //Global Execution Context is created → first() is called.
  //A new Function Execution Context for first() is pushed onto the stack.

  //third() completes → Execution Context is removed (popped).
  //second() completes → Execution Context is removed.
  //first() completes → Execution Context is removed
  //Global Execution Context is removed → Program Ends. 

//EXECUTION CONTEXT WORKS IN LAST IN FIRST OUT PRINCIPLE

//1. Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)
//A Global Execution Context (GEC) is created.
//The this keyword is assigned (in browsers, this refers to window).
//Variables (var) and function declarations are stored in memory (MEMORY ALLOCATION PHASE) (hoisting).

//2. Execution Phase (Code Execution)
//The code runs line by line.
//Variables are assigned values.
//Function calls create new Function Execution Contexts (FECs)

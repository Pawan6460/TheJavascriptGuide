    // The Call Stack is a data structure that JavaScript uses to manage function execution. It follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, 
    // meaning the last function called is the first to complete

   // Whenever a function is called:
//1️⃣ A new Execution Context is created and pushed onto the Call Stack.
//2️⃣ The function executes.
//3️⃣ Once execution is complete, the Execution Context is popped from the stack.
//4️⃣ JavaScript moves back to the previous function in the stack.

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  
  function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
  }
  
  greet();
  sayGoodbye();
  console.log("End of script");

 // If a function calls itself indefinitely,
 // the call stack keeps growing until JavaScript throws a stack overflow

    infiniteRecursion();

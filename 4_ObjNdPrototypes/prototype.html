    // what is prototype
    // every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]],
    // which is a reference to another object. This mechanism is known as prototypal inheritance.

    //If a property or method is not found on an object,
    // JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches null.

    // example of prototype chain
    const person = {
        greet: function () {
          console.log("Hello!");
        }
      };
      
      const student = Object.create(person); // student inherits from person
      
      student.study = function () {
        console.log("Studying...");
      };
      
      student.greet(); // ✅ Inherited from person
      student.study(); // ✅ Exists on student
      console.log(student.hasOwnProperty("greet")); // ❌ false (not its own property)


      // constructor funtion
      // Instead of defining greet inside the constructor, we add it to the prototype to save memory.
      // All instances of Person can access greet() without duplicating it.
      function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
      
      // Adding a method to the prototype
      Person.prototype.greet = function () {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
      };
      
      const john = new Person("John", 25);
      const alice = new Person("Alice", 30);
      
      john.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John"
      alice.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
